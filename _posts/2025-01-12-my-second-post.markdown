In my first post, I mentioned that this blog is built with Jekyll, a static site generator. But what exactly is a static site generator, and why would you want to use one?

A static site generator is a tool that takes your content, applies it to a template, and generates a set of static HTML files. These files can then be served by any web server, without the need for a database or a server-side programming language.

### Benefits of Static Sites

There are several benefits to this approach:

*   **Speed:** Static sites are incredibly fast. Since there's no database to query or dynamic content to generate, the server can simply send the HTML file directly to the user's browser.
*   **Security:** Static sites are also very secure. With no database or server-side code, there are far fewer vulnerabilities to exploit.
*   **Simplicity:** Static site generators are often much simpler to use than traditional content management systems. You can write your content in Markdown, a simple and intuitive markup language, and the generator takes care of the rest.
*   **Version Control:** Since your content is just a set of text files, you can easily use a version control system like Git to track changes and collaborate with others.

### Why I Chose Jekyll

There are many static site generators to choose from, but I ultimately decided to go with Jekyll for a few reasons. First, it's the engine behind GitHub Pages, which makes it incredibly easy to deploy and host a site for free. Second, it has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources and plugins available.

I'm still new to the world of static site generators, but I'm already a big fan. I'm excited to continue exploring this technology and to see what else I can build with it.
